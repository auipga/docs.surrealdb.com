# Overview

The [SurrealDB SDK for Java](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.surrealdb/surrealdb) is the primary SDK for interacting with SurrealDB from the Java Runtime Environment. It is designed to be used in a number of environments, including client-side applications, server-side applications, and mobile applications. The SDK is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, and provides a number of built-in functions for connecting to a database, performing queries, and managing data.

In addition to opening connections to remote databases, the SDK also supports embedded databases, allowing developers to create and manage databases within their own applications.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> The SDK works seamlessly with SurrealDB version <Version />, ensuring compatibility with the latest features and improvements of the database system.
