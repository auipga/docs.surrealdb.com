# Quick start

This guide will teach you the basics of using the SurrealDB SDK for Java to interact with a SurrealDB instance. We will cover topics such as installing the SDK, connecting to an in-memory database, and performing basic queries.
For demonstration purposes, the presented queries follow the example of a library database.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can find a working example project implementing the queries described in the guide in our [surrealdb-examples](https://github.com/surrealdb/examples/tree/main/java-starter) repository

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes the following:
- You have a basic understanding of Java and the Java Runtime Environment.
- You have Java 8 or higher installed on your machine.
- You have a suitable IDE installed, such as [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/).

## Setup

### Install the SDK

The SurrealDB Java SDK is available on the Maven Central repository. You can install it using [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) or [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).
Copy the following relevant code snippet into your `build.gradle` or `pom.xml` file to add the SDK as a dependency:

<Tabs groupId="java-build-tool">
  <TabItem value="gradle-groovy" label="Gradle (Groovy)" default>
```groovy
ext {
    surrealdbVersion = "0.2.0"
}

dependencies {
    implementation "com.surrealdb:surrealdb:${surrealdbVersion}"
}
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="gradle-kotlin" label="Gradle (Kotlin)">
```groovy
val surrealdbVersion by extra("0.2.0")

dependencies {
    implementation("com.surrealdb:surrealdb:${surrealdbVersion}")
}
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="maven" label="Maven">
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.surrealdb</groupId>
    <artifactId>surrealdb</artifactId>
    <version>0.2.0</version>
</dependency>
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Initialize the SDK

The first step towards sending queries is instantiating the driver. In the following example we use a try-with-resources block to ensure the driver is properly closed after use.
After instantiating the driver, we will connect to an in-memory database, and select our namespace and database.

```java title="SurrealDB.java"
package me.yourname.example;

import com.surrealdb.Surreal;

public class SurrealDB {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

		// Instantiate the driver
		try (final Surreal driver = new Surreal()) {
			// Connect to an in-memory database
			driver.connect("memory");

			// Select a namespace and database
			driver.useNs("example").useDb("example");

			// ...
		}
    }

}
```

### Defining model classes

In order to represent database records within your application, you need to define [POJO](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_Java_object) classes that match the tables in your database.
Additionally, model classes require a public no-argument constructor to be used with the SDK.

For this example, we will create a `Book` class representing book records in our database.

```java title="Book.java"
package me.yourname.surrealdb;

import com.surrealdb.RecordId;

public class Book {
    public RecordId id;
    public String title;
    public String author;
    public String isbn;

    //  A default constructor is required
    public Book() {
    }

    public Book(String title, String author, String isbn) {
        this.title = title;
        this.author = author;
        this.isbn = isbn;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Book{" +
                "id=" + id +
                ", title='" + title + '\'' +
                ", author=" + author +
                ", isbn='" + isbn + '\'' +
                '}';
    }
}
```

Model classes are extremely useful as they can be used to represent more than just tables, such as complex query responses, relations, and more.
Additionally, the fields in model classes can contain nested objects, arrays, and other SurrealDB data types.

You can learn more about SurrealDB data types on the [data types](/docs/sdk/java/data-types) page.

## Using SDK methods

### Creating new records

Before we can query data, we need to create some records. There are two primary methods for creating records: `create` and `insert`.

```java title="Book.java"
package me.yourname.surrealdb;

import com.surrealdb.RecordId;

public class Book {
    public RecordId id;
    public String title;
    public String author;
    public String isbn;

    //  A default constructor is required
    public Book() {
    }

    public Book(String title, String author, String isbn) {
        this.title = title;
        this.author = author;
        this.isbn = isbn;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Book{" +
                "id=" + id +
                ", title='" + title + '\'' +
                ", author=" + author +
                ", isbn='" + isbn + '\'' +
                '}';
    }
}

```

### Selecting records

### Updating records

### Deleting records

### Relations

### Complex queries

## Completion

Once you have completed this guide, your project will have the following structure:

```bash
my-surreal-library/
└─ src/main/java/me/yourname/library
    ├─ SurrealDB.java
    ├─ CreateUser.java
    ├─ QueryUser.java
    ├─ UpdateUser.java
    ├─ DeleteUser.java
    ├─ Main.java
```

## Next steps

Now that you have learned the basics of the SurrealDB SDK for Java, you can learn more about the SDK and its methods [in the methods section](/docs/sdk/javascript/methods) and [data types section](/docs/sdk/javascript/data-types).
