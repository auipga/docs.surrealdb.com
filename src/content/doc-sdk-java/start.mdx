# Quick start

This guide will teach you the basics of using the SurrealDB SDK for Java to interact with a SurrealDB instance. We will cover topics such as installing the SDK, connecting to an in-memory database, and performing basic queries.
For demonstration purposes, the presented queries follow the example of a library database.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can find a working example project implementing the queries described in the guide in our [surrealdb-examples](https://github.com/surrealdb/examples/tree/main/java-starter) repository

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes the following:
- You have a basic understanding of Java and the Java Runtime Environment.
- You have Java 8 or higher installed on your machine.
- You have a suitable IDE installed, such as [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/).

## Setup

### Install the SDK

The SurrealDB Java SDK is available on the Maven Central repository. You can install it using [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) or [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).
Copy the following relevant code snippet into your `build.gradle` or `pom.xml` file to add the SDK as a dependency:

<Tabs groupId="java-build-tool">
  <TabItem value="gradle-groovy" label="Gradle (Groovy)" default>
```groovy
ext {
    surrealdbVersion = "0.2.0"
}

dependencies {
    implementation "com.surrealdb:surrealdb:${surrealdbVersion}"
}
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="gradle-kotlin" label="Gradle (Kotlin)">
```groovy
val surrealdbVersion by extra("0.2.0")

dependencies {
    implementation("com.surrealdb:surrealdb:${surrealdbVersion}")
}
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="maven" label="Maven">
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.surrealdb</groupId>
    <artifactId>surrealdb</artifactId>
    <version>0.2.0</version>
</dependency>
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Initialize the SDK

The first step towards sending queries is instantiating the driver. In the following example we use a try-with-resources block to ensure the driver is properly closed after use.
After instantiating the driver, we will connect to an in-memory database, and select our namespace and database.

```java title="SurrealDB.java"
package me.yourname.example;

import com.surrealdb.Surreal;

public class SurrealDB {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

		// Instantiate the driver
		try (final Surreal driver = new Surreal()) {
			// Connect to an in-memory database
			driver.connect("memory");

			// Select a namespace and database
			driver.useNs("example").useDb("example");

			// ...
		}
    }

}
```

### Defining model classes

In order to represent database records within your application, you need to define [POJO](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_Java_object) classes that match the tables in your database.
Additionally, model classes require a public no-argument constructor to be used with the SDK.

For this example, we will create a `Book` class representing book records in our database.

```java title="Book.java"
package me.yourname.surrealdb;

import com.surrealdb.RecordId;

import java.time.ZonedDateTime;

public class Book {
    public RecordId id;
    public String title;
    public String author;
    public ZonedDateTime publishedAt;
    public boolean available;

    //  A default constructor is required
    public Book() {
    }

    public Book(String title, String author, ZonedDateTime publishedAt, boolean available) {
        this.title = title;
        this.author = author;
        this.publishedAt = publishedAt;
        this.available = available;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Book{" +
                "id=" + id +
                ", title='" + title + '\'' +
                ", author='" + author + '\'' +
                ", publishedAt=" + publishedAt +
                ", available=" + available +
                '}';
    }
}
```

Model classes are extremely useful as they can be used to represent more than just tables, such as complex query responses, relations, and more.
Additionally, the fields in model classes can contain nested objects, arrays, and other SurrealDB data types.

You can learn more about supported SurrealDB data types on the [data types](/docs/sdk/java/data-types) page.

## Using SDK methods

### Creating new records

The first step towards querying data is to populate the database with records. This can be achieved using the `create` method, which allows you to pass model class instances to create new records.

In the following example, we instantiate a new `Book` object and pass it to the `create` method. This method will return a list of created `Book` records, each with a unique record id.

```java
 // Create a new book
Book book = new Book(
	"Aeon's Surreal Renaissance",
	"Dave MacLeod",
	ZonedDateTime.parse("2024-10-15T00:00:00Z"),
	true
);

// Create a book record
Book created = driver.create(Book.class, "book", book).get(0);

// Print the record id
System.out.println("Created a new book with id " + created.id);
```

Since `create` allows us to create multiple records at once, it returns a list of books. In this case, we only created one book, so we use `.get(0)` to retrieve it.

You might also want to create records with a specific ID. In this case, you can pass the `RecordId` as the second argument to the `create` method.
This approach will return the `Book` instance directly instead of a list.

```java
// Create a book record with a custom id
Book created = driver.create(Book.class, new RecordId("book", "aeon"), book);
```

### Selecting records

Now we have records in our database, we can query them using the `select` method. This method allows you to retrieve either all records from a table, or select a single record by its ID.

```java
// Select all books
Iterator<Book> books = driver.select(Book.class, "book");

while (books.hasNext()) {
	System.out.println("Found book: " + books.next().title);
}

 // Select a specific book
Optional<Book> aeon = driver.select(Book.class, new RecordId("book", "aeon"));

aeon.ifPresent(value -> {
	System.out.println("Found book: " + value.title);
});
```

While the `select` method is useful for retrieving all records or a single record by ID, you may want to perform filtering, ordering, and other operations on your select queries.
In these situations you can use the `query` method to execute custom SurrealQL queries. We will cover this in the [Complex queries](#complex-queries) section.

### Updating records

Records can be updated using the `update` and `upsert` methods. These methods allow you to update all records of a table, or a single record by its ID.

In the following example we update the availability status of a book record. We pass the id of the record we want to update, the type of update we want to perform, and the updated record.
The `UpType.MERGE` parameter tells the SDK to merge the updated record with the existing record, keeping any fields that are not present in the updated record.

After the update is applied, a new `Book` instance is returned with the updated fields.

```java
// Modify an existing book record
existing.available = false;

// Update the book record
Book updated = driver.update(Book.class, existing.id, UpType.MERGE, existing);

// Print the book status
System.out.println("New availability: " + updated.available);
```

You can pass a table name instead of a record ID to update all records in a table. This will return an iterator of updated records.

```java
// Create an empty book instance
Book update = new Book();

update.available = true;

// Update all book records
Iterator<Book> updated = driver.update(Book.class, "book", UpType.MERGE, update);
```

### Deleting records

### Relations

### Complex queries
